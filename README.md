# Project Lightfold

Built for the Desert Bus Game Jam 2020, between 2020-11-13 and 2020-11-19.

Using Love2D and a bunch of libraries.

Be warned, this code is bad, it was for a gamejam and was never intended for "production".

## Building
1. Install [makelove](https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove)
2. Run `makelove --version-name 1` at the top level of the repo
3. Windows and MacOS build will be located in `<repo>/makelove-builds/1`
